#### How many hours to complete ?

    12 Hrs

#### Which required and optional stories have been completed ?

- Required:
    - (✓) Dragging the headline should reveal the menu
    - (✓) If you're dragging down, releasing the headline should animate the headline to the down position
    - (✓) If you're dragging up, releasing the headline should animate the headline to the up position
    - (✓) If you're dragging the headline up past the top, the friction should increase
- Optional:
    - (✓) Fade in different headlines every few seconds
    - (x) Dragging on the scrollable feed of headlines should change the scale of the feed (was able to control the vertical drag so that the newsfeed scroll would not activate, but could not control the scaling correctly so that the end frame is same size as the screen)
